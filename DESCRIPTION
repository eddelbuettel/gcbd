Description: GPU/CPU Benchmarking for Debian-package based system
 This package benchmarks performance of a few standard linear algebra
 operations (such as a matrix product) across a number of different
 BLAS applications as well as available GPU implementations.
 .
 To do so, it takes advantage of the ability to 'plug and play' different
 BLAS implementations easily on a Debian and/or Ubuntu system.  The current
 version supports
  - reference blas (refblas) which are unaccelerated as a baseline
  - Atlas which are tuned but typically configure single-threaded
  - Goto Blas which are accelerated and multithreaded
  - Intel MKL which are a commercial accelerated and multithreaded version.
 As for GPU computing, we the CRAN packages
  - gputools
  - magma
 .
 For Goto Blas, the gotoblas2-helper script from the ISM in Tokyo can be
 used. For Intel MKL we use the Revolution R packages from Ubuntu 9.10.
