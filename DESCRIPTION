Description: 'GPU'/CPU Benchmarking on Debian-package based systems
 This package benchmarks performance of a few standard linear algebra
 operations (such as a matrix product and QR, SVD and LU decompositions)
 across a number of different 'BLAS' libraries as well as a 'GPU' implementation.
 To do so, it takes advantage of the ability to 'plug and play' different
 'BLAS' implementations easily on a Debian and/or Ubuntu system.  The current
 version supports
  - 'Reference BLAS' ('refblas') which are un-accelerated as a baseline
  - Atlas which are tuned but typically configure single-threaded
  - Atlas39 which are tuned and configured for multi-threaded mode
  - 'Goto Blas' which are accelerated and multi-threaded
  - 'Intel MKL' which is a commercial accelerated and multithreaded version.
 As for 'GPU' computing, we use the CRAN package
  - 'gputools'
 For 'Goto Blas', the 'gotoblas2-helper' script from the ISM in Tokyo can be
 used. For 'Intel MKL' we use the Revolution R packages from Ubuntu 9.10.
